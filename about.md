## About Us

CubingUSA was formed to support the speedcubing community in the United States.
 - We have been organizing Rubik's Cube US Nationals or Worlds every year since 2004. US Nationals 2016 features 600 competitors!
 - We support the organizers of local competitions in the US, in cooperation with the World Cube Association (WCA).*
 - We financially support the WCA itself with administration and server costs, for the benefit of all speedcubers.
 - We are always looking for other opportunities to support and promote twisty puzzle solving!

\* Note that the World Cube Association is an independent organization from CubingUSA.
